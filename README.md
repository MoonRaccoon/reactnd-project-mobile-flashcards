# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is my finished project for the final assessment of Udacity's React Native course. Users are able to build decks of flash cards, and quiz themselves.

## Try it out

To get the app up and running:

* Download or Clone the project to your machine 

* Run yarn install and yarn start
    
Then, either scan a QR code with the Expo app on a mobile device, or launch an emulator
